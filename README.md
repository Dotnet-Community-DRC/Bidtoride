* This guideline will help new contributors understand what to do when they join the project:
* 
1. Familiarize yourself with the project: Start by reading the project's documentation, including the README file, to understand its purpose, features, and architecture. Familiarize yourself with the technologies used, such as .NET, Docker, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, and PostgreSQL.
2. Set up your development environment: Install the necessary software and tools required to contribute to the project. This includes installing .NET SDK, Docker, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, and PostgreSQL. Follow the project's documentation for specific instructions on setting up the development environment.
3. Explore the codebase: Take some time to explore the project's codebase. Understand the project structure, naming conventions, and coding standards followed by the team. This will help you navigate the codebase and make meaningful contributions.
4. Identify an area of interest: Identify a specific area or feature of the project that you would like to contribute to. This could be a bug fix, a new feature, or an improvement to existing functionality. Discuss your ideas with the project maintainers or other contributors to ensure alignment with the project's goals.
5. Create a new branch: Before making any changes, create a new branch in the project's version control system (e.g., Git). This will allow you to work on your changes independently without affecting the main codebase. Follow the project's branching strategy and naming conventions when creating your branch.
6. Write clean and well-tested code: When making changes to the codebase, follow the project's coding standards and best practices. Write clean, modular, and maintainable code. Ensure that your changes are thoroughly tested to maintain the project's quality standards.
7. Submit a pull request: Once you have completed your changes and tested them locally, submit a pull request to the project's repository. Provide a clear and concise description of your changes, including the problem you are addressing and the solution you have implemented. Be open to feedback and iterate on your changes based on the feedback received.
8. Collaborate and communicate: Engage with the project maintainers and other contributors through the project's communication channels, such as issue trackers, mailing lists, or chat platforms. Seek guidance when needed and offer assistance to others. Collaboration and effective communication are key to successful open-source contributions.
9. Follow the project's release process: If your pull request is accepted, your changes will be merged into the main codebase. Follow the project's release process to ensure that your changes are included in future releases. This may involve additional steps such as versioning, documentation updates, and release notes.
